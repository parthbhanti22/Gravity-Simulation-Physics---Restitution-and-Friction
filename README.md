# üß™ Ball Physics Simulation in C++ using OpenGL & GLFW

This project is a **real-time 2D physics simulation** of a ball bouncing under the effects of **gravity**, **restitution**, and **friction**, rendered using **OpenGL** and managed through the **GLFW** windowing system.

# üß† Motivation

This simulation was created to visually demonstrate **Newtonian mechanics** in a game-like environment, focusing on:

* How **gravity** affects objects over time.
* How **energy is conserved or lost** in collisions (via **restitution**).
* How surfaces apply **friction**, reducing velocity.


  # üìê Physics Concepts in Depth

The core of this simulation is based on the fundamental laws of motion:

## 1. Gravity

**Physics Formula:**
$v_y = v_{y_0} + g \cdot \Delta t$

**Code:**
```cpp
vy += gravity * deltaTime;
```
## 2. Position Update
**Physics Formula:**
s = s + v * Œît

Code:

```cpp
x += vx * deltaTime;
y += vy * deltaTime;
```
Explanation:
The ball‚Äôs new position in X and Y is computed using the current velocity and time elapsed. This keeps the movement frame rate independent.
